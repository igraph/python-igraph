class Matching(object):
    """A matching of vertices in a graph.

    A matching of an undirected graph is a set of edges such that each
    vertex is incident on at most one matched edge. When each vertex is
    incident on I{exactly} one matched edge, the matching called
    I{perfect}. This class is used in C{igraph} to represent non-perfect
    and perfect matchings in undirected graphs.

    This class is usually not instantiated directly, everything
    is taken care of by the functions that return matchings.

    Examples:

      >>> from igraph import Graph
      >>> g = Graph.Famous("noperfectmatching")
      >>> matching = g.maximum_matching()
