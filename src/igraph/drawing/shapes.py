Shape drawing classes for igraph

Vertex shapes in igraph are usually referred to by short names like
C{"rect"} or C{"circle"}. This module contains the classes that
implement the actual drawing routines for these shapes, and a
resolver class that determines the appropriate shape drawer class
given the short name.

Classes that are derived from L{ShapeDrawer} in this module are
automatically registered by L{ShapeDrawerDirectory}. If you
implement a custom shape drawer, you must register it in
L{ShapeDrawerDirectory} manually if you wish to refer to it by a
name in the C{shape} attribute of vertices.
