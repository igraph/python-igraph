=====================
Connected Components
=====================

This example demonstrates how to visualise the connected components in a graph using :meth:`igraph.GraphBase.connected_components`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 10-14

.. code-block:: default

    import igraph as ig
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import random

First, we generate a randomized geometric graph with random vertex sizes. The
seed is set to the example is reproducible in our manual: you don't really
need it to understand the concepts.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 18-21

.. code-block:: default

    random.seed(0)
    g = ig.Graph.GRG(50, 0.15)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 22-24

Now we can cluster the graph into weakly connected components, i.e. subgraphs
that have no edges connecting them to one another:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 24-26

.. code-block:: default

    components = g.connected_components(mode='weak')








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 27-28

Finally, we can visualize the distinct connected components of the graph:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 28-39

.. code-block:: default

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ig.plot(
        components,
        target=ax,
        palette=ig.RainbowPalette(),
        vertex_size=0.07,
        vertex_color=list(map(int, ig.rescale(components.membership, (0, 200), clamp=True))),
        edge_width=0.7
    )
    plt.show()

.. note::

    We use the integers from 0 to 200 instead of 0 to 255 in our vertex
    colors, since 255 in the :class:`igraph.drawing.colors.RainbowPalette`
    corresponds to looping back to red. This gives us nicely distinct hues.
