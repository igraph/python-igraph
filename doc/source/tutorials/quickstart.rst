===========
Quick Start
===========
For the eager folks out there, this intro will give you a quick overview of the following operations:

- Construct a graph
- Set attributes of nodes and edges
- Plot a graph using matplotlib
- Save the plot as an image
- Export and import a graph as a ``.gml`` file
