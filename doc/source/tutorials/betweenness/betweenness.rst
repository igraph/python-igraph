=======================
Betweenness
=======================

This example demonstrates how to visualize both vertex and edge betweenness with a custom defined color palette. We use the methods :meth:`igraph.GraphBase.betweenness` and :meth:`igraph.GraphBase.edge_betweenness` respectively, and demonstrate the effects on a standard `Krackhardt Kite <https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Krackhardt_kite_graph>`_ graph, as well as a `Watts-Strogatz <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts%E2%80%93Strogatz_model>`_ random graph.

First we import |igraph| and some libraries for plotting et al:

.. code-block:: python

    import random
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from matplotlib.cm import ScalarMappable
    from matplotlib.colors import LinearSegmentedColormap, Normalize
    import igraph as ig

Next we define a function for drawing a graph on an Matplotlib axis. We set the color and size of each vertex and edge based on the betweenness value, and also generate some color bars on the sides to see how they translate to each other. We use `Matplotlib's Normalize class <https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.colors.Normalize.html>`_ to ensure that our color bar ranges are correct, as well as *igraph*'s :meth:`igraph.utils.rescale` to rescale the betweennesses in the interval ``[0, 1]``:

.. code-block:: python

    def plot_betweenness(g, ax, cax1, cax2):
        '''Plot vertex/edge betweenness, with colorbars
    
        Args:
            g: the graph to plot.
            ax: the Axes for the graph
            cax1: the Axes for the vertex betweenness colorbar
            cax2: the Axes for the edge betweenness colorbar
        '''
    
        # Calculate vertex betweenness and scale it to be between 0.0 and 1.0
        vertex_betweenness = g.betweenness()
        edge_betweenness = g.edge_betweenness()
        scaled_vertex_betweenness = ig.rescale(vertex_betweenness, clamp=True)
        scaled_edge_betweenness = ig.rescale(edge_betweenness, clamp=True)
        print(f"vertices: {min(vertex_betweenness)} - {max(vertex_betweenness)}")
        print(f"edges: {min(edge_betweenness)} - {max(edge_betweenness)}")
    
        # Define mappings betweenness -> color
        cmap1 = LinearSegmentedColormap.from_list("vertex_cmap", ["pink", "indigo"])
        cmap2 = LinearSegmentedColormap.from_list("edge_cmap", ["lightblue", "midnightblue"])
    
        # Plot graph
        g.vs["color"] = [cmap1(betweenness) for betweenness in scaled_vertex_betweenness]
        g.vs["size"]  = ig.rescale(vertex_betweenness, (0.1, 0.5))
        g.es["color"] = [cmap2(betweenness) for betweenness in scaled_edge_betweenness]
        g.es["width"] = ig.rescale(edge_betweenness, (0.5, 1.0))
        ig.plot(
            g,
            target=ax,
            layout="fruchterman_reingold",
            vertex_frame_width=0.2,
        )
    
        # Color bars
        norm1 = ScalarMappable(norm=Normalize(0, max(vertex_betweenness)), cmap=cmap1)
        norm2 = ScalarMappable(norm=Normalize(0, max(edge_betweenness)), cmap=cmap2)
        plt.colorbar(norm1, cax=cax1, orientation="horizontal", label='Vertex Betweenness')
        plt.colorbar(norm2, cax=cax2, orientation="horizontal", label='Edge Betweenness')

Finally, we call our function with the two graphs:

.. code-block:: python

    # Generate Krackhardt Kite Graphs and Watts Strogatz graphs
    random.seed(0)
    g1 = ig.Graph.Famous("Krackhardt_Kite")
    g2 = ig.Graph.Watts_Strogatz(dim=1, size=150, nei=2, p=0.1)
    
    # Plot the graphs, each with two colorbars for vertex/edge betweenness
    fig, axs = plt.subplots(
        3, 2,
        figsize=(7, 6),
        gridspec_kw=dict(height_ratios=(15, 1, 1)),
        )
    plot_betweenness(g1, fig, *axs[:, 0])
    plot_betweenness(g2, fig, *axs[:, 1])
    fig.tight_layout(h_pad=1)
    plt.show()

The final output graphs are as follows:

.. figure:: ./figures/betweenness.png
   :alt: A graph visualizing the betweenness of each vertex and edge.
   :align: center

   Vertex and edge betweenness in a Krackhardt Kite graph (left) and in a 150 node Watts-Strogatz graph (right). Edge betweenness is shown in shades of blue and vertex betweenness in shades of purple.

and the output for betweennesss is as follows:

.. code-block::

    vertices: 0.0 - 14.0
    edges: 1.5 - 16.0
    vertices: 0.0 - 1314.629277155593
    edges: 1.0 - 628.2537443550603
