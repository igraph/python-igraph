"""Auxiliary classes for the default graph drawer in igraph.

This module contains heavy metaclass magic. If you don't understand
the logic behind these classes, probably you don't need them either.

igraph's default graph drawer uses various data sources to determine
the visual appearance of vertices and edges. These data sources
are the following (in order of precedence):

  - The keyword arguments passed to the L{igraph.plot()} function
    (or to L{igraph.Graph.__plot__()} as a matter of fact, since
    L{igraph.plot()} just passes these attributes on). For instance,
    a keyword argument named C{vertex_label} can be used to set
    the labels of vertices.

  - The attributes of the vertices/edges being drawn. For instance,
    a vertex that has a C{label} attribute will use that label when
    drawn by the default graph drawer.

  - The global configuration of igraph. For instance, if the global
    L{igraph.config.Configuration} instance has a key called
    C{plotting.vertex_color}, that will be used as a default color
    for the vertices.

  - If all else fails, there is a built-in default; for instance,
    the default vertex color is C{"red"}. This is hard-wired in the
    source code.

The logic above can be useful in other graph drawers as well, not
only in the default one, therefore it is refactored into the classes
found in this module. Different graph drawers may inspect different
vertex or edge attributes, hence the classes that collect the attributes
from the various data sources are generated in run-time using a
metaclass called L{AttributeCollectorMeta}. You don't have to use
L{AttributeCollectorMeta} directly, just implement a subclass of
L{AttributeCollectorBase} and it will ensure that the appropriate
metaclass is used. With L{AttributeCollectorBase}, you can use a
simple declarative syntax to specify which attributes you are
interested in. For example::

    class VisualEdgeBuilder(AttributeCollectorBase):
        arrow_size = 1.0
        arrow_width = 1.0
        color = ("black", palette.get)
        width = 1.0

    for edge in VisualEdgeBuilder(graph.es):
        print edge.color

The above class is a visual edge builder -- a class that gives the
visual attributes of the edges of a graph that is specified at
construction time. It specifies that the attributes we are interested
in are C{arrow_size}, C{arrow_width}, C{color} and C{width}; the
default values are also given. For C{color}, we also specify that
a method called {palette.get} should be called on every attribute
value to translate color names to RGB values. For the other three
attributes, C{float} will implicitly be called on all attribute values,
this is inferred from the type of the default value itself.

class AttributeCollectorMeta(type):
    """Metaclass for attribute collector classes

    Classes that use this metaclass are intended to collect vertex/edge
    attributes from various sources (a Python dict, a vertex/edge sequence,
    default values from the igraph configuration and such) in a given
    order of precedence. See the module documentation for more details.
    This metaclass enables the user to use a simple declarative syntax
    to specify which attributes he is interested in. For each vertex/edge
    attribute, a corresponding class attribute must be defined with a
    value that describes the default value of that attribute if no other
    data source provides us with any suitable value. The default value
    can also be a tuple; in that case, the first element of the tuple
    is the actual default value, the second element is a converter
    function that will convert the attribute values to a format expected
    by the caller who uses the class being defined.

    There is a special class attribute called C{_kwds_prefix}; this is
    not used as an attribute declaration. It can contain a string which
    will be used to derive alternative names for the attributes when
    the attribute is accessed in a Python dict. This is useful in many
    situations; for instance, the default graph drawer would want to access
    the vertex colors using the C{color} vertex attribute, but when
    it looks at the keyword arguments passed to the original call of
    L{igraph.Graph.__plot__}, the C{vertex_color} keyword argument should
    be looked up because we also have colors for the edges. C{_kwds_prefix}
    will be prepended to the attribute names when they are looked up in
    a dict of keyword arguments.

    If you require a more fine-tuned behaviour, you can assign an
    L{AttributeSpecification} instance to a class attribute directly.
