**What is the feature or improvement you would like to see?**
A concise description of the requested feature. If the feature request is about
an algorithm, consider adding your request in the main [igraph
repo](https://github.com/igraph/igraph) instead - in most cases the Python
interface simply provides access to the functionality of the igraph library, so
new algorithms should be added there in general.

**Use cases for the feature**
Explain when and for what purpose the feature would be useful.

**References**
List any relevant references (papers or books describing relevant algorithms).
