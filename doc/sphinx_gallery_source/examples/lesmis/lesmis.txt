The file lesmis.gml contains the weighted network of coappearances of
characters in Victor Hugo's novel "Les Miserables".  Nodes represent
characters as indicated by the labels and edges connect any pair of
characters that appear in the same chapter of the book.  The values on the
edges are the number of such coappearances.  The data on coappearances were
taken from D. E. Knuth, The Stanford GraphBase: A Platform for
Combinatorial Computing, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA (1993).
