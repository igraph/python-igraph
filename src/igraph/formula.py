    Generates a graph from a graph formula

    A graph formula is a simple string representation of a graph.
    It is very handy for creating small graphs quickly. The string
    consists of vertex names separated by edge operators. An edge
    operator is a sequence of dashes (C{-}) that may or may not
    start with an arrowhead (C{<} at the beginning of the sequence
    or C{>} at the end of the sequence). The edge operators can
    be arbitrarily long, i.e., you may use as many dashes to draw
    them as you like. This makes a total of four different edge
    operators:

      - C{-----} makes an undirected edge
      - C{<----} makes a directed edge pointing from the vertex
        on the right hand side of the operator to the vertex on
        the left hand side
      - C{---->} is the opposite of C{<----}
      - C{<--->} creates a mutual directed edge pair between
        the two vertices

    If you only use the undirected edge operator (C{-----}),
    the graph will be undirected. Otherwise it will be directed.
    Vertex names used in the formula will be assigned to the
    C{name} vertex attribute of the graph.

    Some simple examples:

      >>> from igraph import Graph
      >>> print(Graph.Formula())          # empty graph
      IGRAPH UN-- 0 0 --
      + attr: name (v)
      >>> g = Graph.Formula("A-B")        # undirected graph
      >>> g.vs["name"]
      ['A', 'B']
      >>> print(g)
      IGRAPH UN-- 2 1 --
      + attr: name (v)
      + edges (vertex names):
      A--B
      >>> g.get_edgelist()
      [(0, 1)]
      >>> g2 = Graph.Formula("A-----------B")
      >>> g2.isomorphic(g)
      True
      >>> g = Graph.Formula("A  --->  B") # directed graph
      >>> g.vs["name"]
      ['A', 'B']
      >>> print(g)
      IGRAPH DN-- 2 1 --
      + attr: name (v)
      + edges (vertex names):
      A->B

    If you have may disconnected componnets, you can separate them
    with commas. You can also specify isolated vertices:

      >>> g = Graph.Formula("A--B, C--D, E--F, G--H, I, J, K")
      >>> print(", ".join(g.vs["name"]))
      A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K
      >>> g.clusters().membership
      [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6]

    The colon (C{:}) operator can be used to specify vertex sets.
    If an edge operator connects two vertex sets, then every vertex
    from the first vertex set will be connected to every vertex in
    the second set:

      >>> g = Graph.Formula("A:B:C:D --- E:F:G")
      >>> g.isomorphic(Graph.Full_Bipartite(4, 3))
      True

    Note that you have to quote vertex names if they include spaces
    or special characters:

      >>> g = Graph.Formula('"this is" +- "a silly" -+ "graph here"')
      >>> g.vs["name"]
      ['this is', 'a silly', 'graph here']
