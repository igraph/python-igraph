Betweenness
=======================

This example demonstrates how to visualize both vertex and edge betweenness with a custom defined color palette. We use the methods :meth:`igraph.GraphBase.betweenness` and :meth:`igraph.GraphBase.edge_betweenness` respectively, and demonstrate the effects on a standard `Krackhardt Kite <https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Krackhardt_kite_graph>`_ graph, as well as a `Watts-Strogatz <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts%E2%80%93Strogatz_model>`_ random graph.

# %%
# We define a function that plots the graph  on a Matplotlib axis, along with
# its vertex and edge betweenness values. The function also generates some
# color bars on the sides to see how they translate to each other. We use
# `Matplotlib's Normalize class <https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.colors.Normalize.html>`_
# to ensure that our color bar ranges are correct, as well as *igraph*'s
# :meth:`igraph.utils.rescale` to rescale the betweennesses in the interval
# ``[0, 1]``.

# First, generate a graph, e.g. the Krackhardt Kite Graph:
random.seed(0)

# Then we can compute vertex and edge betweenness:
vertex_betweenness1 = g1.betweenness()
edge_betweenness1 = g1.edge_betweenness()

# %% As a second example, we generate and analyze a Watts Strogatz graph:
g2 = ig.Graph.Watts_Strogatz(dim=1, size=150, nei=2, p=0.1)
vertex_betweenness2 = g2.betweenness()
edge_betweenness2 = g2.edge_betweenness()

# Finally, we plot the two graphs, each with two colorbars for vertex/edge
# betweenness
