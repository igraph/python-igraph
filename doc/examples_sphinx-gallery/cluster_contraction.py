===========================
Generating Cluster Graphs
===========================

This example shows how to find the communities in a graph, then contract each community into a single node using :class:`igraph.clustering.VertexClustering`. For this tutorial, we'll use the *Donald Knuth's Les Miserables Network*, which shows the coapperances of characters in the novel *Les Miserables*.

import igraph as ig
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# %%
# We begin by load the graph from file. The file containing this network can be
# downloaded `here <http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/>`_.
g = ig.load("./lesmis/lesmis.gml")

# %%
# Now that we have a graph in memory, we can generate communities using
# :meth:`igraph.Graph.community_edge_betweenness` to separate out vertices into
# clusters. (For a more focused tutorial on just visualising communities, check
# out :ref:`tutorials-visualize-communities`).
communities = g.community_edge_betweenness()

# %%
# For plots, it is convenient to convert the communities into a VertexClustering:
communities = communities.as_clustering()

# %%
# We can also easily print out who belongs to each community:
for i, community in enumerate(communities):
    print(f"Community {i}:")
    for v in community:
        print(f"\t{g.vs[v]['label']}")

# %%
# Finally we can proceed to plotting the graph. In order to make each community
# stand out, we set "community colors" using an igraph palette:
num_communities = len(communities)
palette1 = ig.RainbowPalette(n=num_communities)
for i, community in enumerate(communities):
    g.vs[community]["color"] = i
    community_edges = g.es.select(_within=community)
    community_edges["color"] = i

# %%
# We can use a dirty hack to move the labels below the vertices ;-)
g.vs["label"] = ["\n\n" + label for label in g.vs["label"]]

# %%
# Finally, we can plot the communities:
fig1, ax1 = plt.subplots()
ig.plot(
    communities,
    target=ax1,
    mark_groups=True,
    palette=palette1,
    vertex_size=0.1,
    edge_width=0.5,
)
fig1.set_size_inches(20, 20)


# %%
# Now let's try and contract the information down, using only a single vertex
# to represent each community. We start by defining x, y, and size attributes
# for each node in the original graph:
layout = g.layout_kamada_kawai()
g.vs["x"], g.vs["y"] = list(zip(*layout))
g.vs["size"] = 1
g.es["size"] = 1

# %%
# Then we can generate the cluster graph that compresses each community into a
# single, "composite" vertex using
# :meth:`igraph.VertexClustering.cluster_graph`:
cluster_graph = communities.cluster_graph(
    combine_vertices={
        "x": "mean",
        "y": "mean",
        "color": "first",
        "size": "sum",
    },
    combine_edges={
        "size": "sum",
    },
)

# %%
# .. note::
#
#      We took the mean of x and y values so that the nodes in the cluster
#      graph are placed at the centroid of the original cluster.
#
# .. note::
#
#     ``mean``, ``first``, and ``sum`` are all built-in collapsing functions,
#     along with ``prod``, ``median``, ``max``, ``min``, ``last``, ``random``.
#     You can also define your own custom collapsing functions, which take in a
#     list and return a single element representing the combined attribute
#     value. For more details on igraph contraction, see
#     :meth:`igraph.GraphBase.contract_vertices`.


# %%
# Finally, we can assign colors to the clusters and plot the cluster graph,
# including a legend to make things clear:
palette2 = ig.GradientPalette("gainsboro", "black")
g.es["color"] = [palette2.get(int(i)) for i in ig.rescale(cluster_graph.es["size"], (0, 255), clamp=True)]

fig2, ax2 = plt.subplots()
ig.plot(
    cluster_graph,
    target=ax2,
    palette=palette1,
    # set a minimum size on vertex_size, otherwise vertices are too small
    vertex_size=[max(0.2, size / 20) for size in cluster_graph.vs["size"]],
    edge_color=g.es["color"],
    edge_width=0.8,
)

# Add a legend
legend_handles = []
for i in range(num_communities):
    handle = ax2.scatter(
        [], [],
        s=100,
        facecolor=palette1.get(i),
        edgecolor="k",
        label=i,
    )
    legend_handles.append(handle)

ax2.legend(
    handles=legend_handles,
    title='Community:',
    bbox_to_anchor=(0, 1.0),
    bbox_transform=ax2.transAxes,
)

fig2.set_size_inches(10, 10)
